package sorting;

/*
 *  
 *  Algorithm: 
 *  
 *  initialize an empty queue Q
 *  
 *  place root in the queue and mark it as visited -
 *  while Q is not empty : 
 *  	dequeue a node from Q at curr_node
 *  	Check if the value at curr_node = val
 *  		return if the value is found
 *  	enque all the connected nodes from the curr_node in the Q (i.e. curr_node.left, curr_node.right)
 *  
 *  
 *  Time Complexity :- O(n^2) worst case
 *  
 *  Trivia: Insertion sort is efficient for small data values. 
 *  		Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. 
 *  		it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.
